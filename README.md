The QAWorks functional tests have been developed as a BDD PageObject framework. The tests against the QAWorks Contact Us have been written in Cucumber Gherkin and C#
The project is divided into 3 main parts 
1. The core framework classes which drive the tests
2. The API tests. This project can be developed to run tests for Restful APIs.
3. Functional tests where all the cucumebr steps for the test are presented as Feature files and the corresponding step definitions.

One of the scenarios for testing the Contact Us page for invalid email address fails due to an unhandled server error - HTTP server error 500
